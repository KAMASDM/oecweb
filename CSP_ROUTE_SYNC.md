# CSP Route Synchronization Summary

## Issue Fixed

**Problem:** CRM was working on `/crm/login` but not on `/oeccrm` due to inconsistent CSP headers.

## Root Cause

The `/oeccrm` route (CRM launcher page) had a more restrictive CSP policy compared to the `/crm` route (CRM application), causing:

- Service worker registration failures
- External resource blocking 
- `WebApp` property access errors
- Inconsistent user experience

## Solution Applied

### Before (Inconsistent)
```
/crm/*    → Permissive CSP (working)
/oeccrm/* → Restrictive CSP (broken)
```

### After (Synchronized) 
```
/crm/*    → Permissive CSP ✅
/oeccrm/* → Permissive CSP ✅  
```

## CSP Policy Now Applied to Both Routes

```
default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' data: blob: https: http:;
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' https: http: data: blob:;
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https: http: data:;
img-src 'self' data: blob: https: http:;
font-src 'self' data: https: http:;
connect-src 'self' https: http: wss: ws: data:;
media-src 'self' data: blob: https: http:;
object-src 'none';
base-uri 'self';
frame-ancestors 'self';
worker-src 'self' blob:;
child-src 'self' blob:;
```

## Files Updated

1. **`next.config.mjs`** - Synchronized CSP headers for both route patterns
2. **`netlify.toml`** - Mirrored CSP configuration at Netlify level

## Expected Results

- ✅ CRM works identically on both `/oeccrm` and `/crm/login`
- ✅ No more CSP violations in browser console
- ✅ Service workers register and function properly  
- ✅ External resources load without blocking
- ✅ `WebApp` properties accessible in React code
- ✅ Consistent user experience across all CRM routes

## Verification

After deployment, both routes should:
1. Load the CRM interface successfully
2. Show no CSP errors in browser DevTools console
3. Allow service worker registration
4. Support all React application features

---

**Status:** ✅ CSP synchronized across all CRM routes
