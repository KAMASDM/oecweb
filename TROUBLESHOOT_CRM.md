## 🎯 Most Likely Issues

Based on the favicon error you mentioned, here are possibilities:

- Check if `oeccrm` folder exists in the deployed site

### B. Routing Issue
- Next.js rewrites not working on Netlify
- Netlify redirects not being applied

### C. JavaScript Error
- CRM loads but crashes due to missing dependencies
- Check browser console for React/JavaScript errors
