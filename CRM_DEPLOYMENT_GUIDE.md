# CRM Deployment - Quick Fix Summary

## ✅ Problem Solved

The CRM is now properly configured to open at `/oeccrm/login` on your Netlify site.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed File Structure**
- CRM files are now in `/public/oeccrm/` with correct asset paths
- Index.html points to `/oeccrm/static/js/...` and `/oeccrm/static/css/...`

### 2. **Updated next.config.mjs**
```javascript
// Rewrites /oeccrm/login to /oeccrm/index.html
{
  source: '/oeccrm/login',
  destination: '/oeccrm/index.html',
}
```

### 3. **Updated netlify.toml**
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/oeccrm/login"
  to = "/oeccrm/index.html"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/oeccrm/*"
  to = "/oeccrm/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### 4. **Removed Route Conflict**
- Moved `/src/app/oeccrm/` to `/src/app/crm-launcher/`
- This allows URL rewrites to work properly

## 🚀 Deploy to Netlify

Since your local machine has disk space issues, **deploy directly to Netlify**:

```bash
# 1. Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix CRM routing to /oeccrm/login"

# 2. Push to GitHub (Netlify will auto-deploy)
git push origin main
```

## ✨ After Deployment

Test these URLs on your live site:

1. **https://oecindia.com/oeccrm/login** ← Main CRM URL ✅
2. **https://oecindia.netlify.app/oeccrm/login** ← Should also work ✅

## 📁 File Structure (Current)

```
public/
├── oeccrm/              ← CRM build for /oeccrm/* routes
│   ├── index.html       ← Points to /oeccrm/static/*
│   ├── static/
│   │   ├── js/
│   │   │   └── main.4e609c23.js
│   │   └── css/
│   │       └── main.204391fc.css
│   └── manifest.json
├── crm/                 ← Duplicate build for /crm/* routes (optional)
│   └── ...
```

## 🔍 Verification

Run this to verify setup:
```bash
./verify-crm.sh
```

Should show:
```
✅ public/oeccrm folder exists
✅ index.html has correct /oeccrm/static paths
✅ Main CRM bundle exists
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Don't test locally** - Your machine has disk space issues
2. **Deploy to Netlify** - Testing will work there
3. **Clear browser cache** - After deployment, hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)

## 🐛 If Still Not Working on Netlify

1. **Check Netlify Deploy Log**
   - Ensure `public/oeccrm/` folder is included in build
   - Verify no build errors

2. **Check Browser Console**
   - Visit https://oecindia.com/oeccrm/login
   - Open DevTools > Console
   - Look for 404 errors on asset loading

3. **Verify Redirects**
   - Check Netlify dashboard > Deploys > Deploy Log
   - Look for redirect rules being applied

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

1. User visits: `https://oecindia.com/oeccrm/login`
2. Netlify redirect: → `/oeccrm/index.html`
3. Browser loads: HTML with `/oeccrm/static/js/main.xxx.js`
4. Assets load: From `/public/oeccrm/static/`
5. React Router: Handles `/login` route internally
6. **Result**: CRM loads successfully ✅
