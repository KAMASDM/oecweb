# UI/UX Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Home Page "Explore Premium" Button
**Problem:** Non-functional button with no navigation
**Solution:** 
- ✅ Renamed to "Explore Our Services" 
- ✅ Added proper Link to `/services` page
- ✅ Maintained visual styling and animations

### 2. Mobile Bottom Navigation Issues
**Problems:** 
- Logo not rendering in center button
- Active status bar intersecting the logo
- Poor visual hierarchy

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Fixed logo rendering (switched from `<img>` to Next.js `<Image>`)
- ✅ Added `z-index` to center button to prevent overlap
- ✅ Removed active indicator bar for home/center item
- ✅ Enhanced individual item indicators (larger, animated pulse)
- ✅ Improved spacing and visual feedback

### 3. Content Security Policy (CSP) Issues
**Problem:** CSP blocking CRM functionality on `/oeccrm`
**Solutions:**
- ✅ Ultra-permissive CSP for all `/oeccrm` routes
- ✅ Added layout-level CSP as fallback
- ✅ Synchronized CSP across Next.js and Netlify configs

## Technical Implementation

### CSP Strategy:
```
Ultra-permissive for CRM routes:
- script-src: * 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'
- All resources: * data: blob: https: http:
- Maximum compatibility for React apps
```

### Navigation Enhancement:
```
Smart indicator system:
- Hide top bar for center/home item
- Enhanced dots for regular items
- Z-index management for logo overlap
```

### Accessibility:
- ✅ Proper ARIA labels maintained
- ✅ Keyboard navigation preserved
- ✅ Screen reader compatibility
- ✅ Touch target optimization
