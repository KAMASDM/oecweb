                </h2>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Overseas Education Center (OEC) was established with the core objective of helping students in achieving their dreams of overseas education. Since conception in 2003, we have worked to develop our expertise for overseas education and visa formalities. Over the years we have also created a robust network with leading institutions worldwide that gives us the ability to provide better education services to our students.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  OEC was founded by Mr Jagat Patel, a graduate of Webster University from the United Kingdom. He is a well-known personality in the education industry in the South Asia region.

                    Why We Started OEC India
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Every year, thousands of talented Indian students dream of
                    studying abroad but face numerous challenges: information
                    overload, hidden costs, unreliable guidance, and lack of
                    personalized support. We've seen too many students make
                    costly mistakes or miss opportunities simply because they
                    didn't have access to the right guidance at the right time.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    OEC India was born to bridge this gap. We believe that every
                    student deserves transparent, expert guidance that puts
                    their interests first. Our approach goes beyond just
                    securing admissions - we're committed to ensuring long-term
                    success, from the initial university search to graduation
                    and beyond.
