  <h2>Traditional Maori Medicines</h2>

  <p>The Maori are the indigenous people of the islands of New Zealand. Their traditional medicine, which is believed to date back as far as the 13th century, was a system of healing that was passed down through the generations orally. It comprised diverse practices and placed an emphasis on the spiritual dimension of health. Its practice included remedies made from herbs, and physical therapies such as massage to relieve discomfort in the muscles and bones.</p>

  <p>Maori systems for treating illness were well developed before Europeans arrived in New Zealand in the late 1700s: they had quite detailed knowledge of anatomy and recognition of the healing properties of various plants. When Europeans first visited New Zealand, the average age of death for Maori adults was around 30. However, apart from this, the people were fit and healthy, and troubled by few diseases.</p>

  <p>Illness was often seen as spiritually based. Maori saw themselves as guardians of the earth, and the focus of their existence was to remain at one with the natural and supernatural world. Rather than a medical problem, sickness was often viewed as a symptom of disharmony with nature.</p>

  <p>In Maori culture, illnesses were divided into diseases of the gods (mate atua) and physical diseases (mate tangata). Diseases sent by the gods were often attributed to attacks by evil spirits, because the person had broken a religious rule. For instance, for Maori, places where people had died or places where their ancestors were buried were sacred. So if someone took food from a river where someone had died, or took a stick from a tree that had held their ancestor's bones and placed it on a cooking fire, it was believed that the gods could punish them for their disrespectful acts by making them sick.</p>

  <p>More than 200 plants were used medicinally by Maori. The leaves of the flax plant were used to treat skin infections and food poisoning, and the hard part of the leaf was also used as a splint or brace for broken bones and injured backs. Flax fibers were used along with a sharpened stick to sew up bad cuts. The bark and leaves of the pepper tree were used to heal cuts, wounds, and stomach pain. People who had toothache were instructed to chew the leaves of this same tree, and this was found to be of considerable benefit. The pepper tree was also used in vapor baths to treat people with painful joints.</p>

  <p>Colonization by Europeans in the 1800s had a significant effect on traditional Maori healing. Europeans brought many new diseases with them which Maori healers had limited ability to combat. Though Western medicine was also relatively ineffectual at the time, this failure still strongly affected Maori confidence in their healers. Some Western missionaries attributed the spread of disease to the fact that the Maori did not believe in Christianity, and as Maori healers appeared powerless, many Maori accepted this explanation and turned to Christianity. Over time, the schools of higher learning which had trained healers started to close and the tradition of the Maori healer declined.</p>

  <p>From the late 20th century, there was renewed Maori interest in their traditional medicine. This was due to several factors. There was a resurgence of all aspects of Maori culture in New Zealand. Furthermore, people started to be less trusting of Western medicine—statistics from the 1970s revealed that Maori health continued to be poorer than that of other New Zealanders. There were also problems with access to health care for Maori. Additionally, there was, and still is today, a perceived lack of a spiritual dimension in Western health services.</p>

  <p>Although Maori today largely accept Western concepts of health and illness, and use the mainstream health system, there is significant demand for traditional medicine. This is true for unusual illnesses or those that fail to respond to standard medical treatment, but also for common ailments such as the cold and influenza.</p>

  <p>Today's healers differ significantly from those of old times. Training is highly variable, usually informal, and often less tribally bound than the rigorous education of the traditional houses of higher learning. Many modern healers work in urban clinics, some alongside mainstream health professionals. They experiment, incorporating knowledge from Western and other medical systems. As a result, their modern-day work has no standard system of diagnosis or widespread agreement about treatments. Despite this, many healers are recognized as having knowledge and ability that has been passed down from their ancestors. The Maori language is also seen as important by many of those receiving treatment.</p>

The primary function of the skeleton is to aid movement of other parts. Their skull acts as a fulcrum and their vertebrae act as levers. The vertebral column consists of a series of vertebrae held together by ligaments, but not so tightly as to prevent slight sideways movement between each pair of vertebrae. The whole spine is, therefore, flexible. The skull is the only truly fixed part of a fish. It does not move in and off itself but acts as a point of stability for other bones. These other bones act as levers that cause movement of the fish&rsquo;s body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>C</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the bones provide the movement, the muscles supply the power. A typical fish has hundreds of muscles running in all directions around its body. This is why a fish can turn and twist and change directions quickly. The muscles on each side of the spine contract in a series from head to tail and down each side alternately, causing a wave-like movement to pass down the body. Such a movement may be very pronounced in fish such as eels, but hardly perceptible in others, e.g. mackerel. The frequency of the waves varies from about 50/min in the dogfish to 170/min in the mackerel. The sideways and backward thrust of the head and body against the water results in the resistance of the water pushing the fish sideways and forwards in a direction opposed to the thrust. When the corresponding set of muscles on the other side contracts, the fish experiences a similar force from the water on that side. The two sideways forces are equal and opposite unless the fish is making a turn, so they cancel out, leaving the sum of the two forward forces</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>D</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The muscles involved in swimming are of two main types. The bulk of a fish&rsquo;s body is composed of the so-called white muscle, while the much smaller areas at the roots of the fins and in a strip along the centre of each flank comprise red muscle. The red muscle receives a good supply of blood and contains ampler quantities of fat and glycogen, the storage form of glucose, which is used for most day-to-day swimming movements. In contrast, the white muscle has a poor blood supply and few energy stores, and it is used largely for short-term, fast swimming. It might seem odd that the body of an animal which adapts adapted so efficiently to its environment should be composed almost entirely of a type of muscle it rarely uses. However, this huge auxiliary power pack carried by a fish is of crucial significance if the life of the fish is threatened-by a predator, for instance-because it enables the fish to swim rapidly away from danger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>E</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fins are the most distinctive features of a fish, composed of bony spines protruding from the body with skin covering them and joining them together, either in a webbed fashion, as seen in most bony fish, or more similar to a flipper, as seen in sharks. These usually serve as a means for the fish to swim. But it must be emphasized that the swimming movements are produced by the whole of the muscular body, and in only a few fish do the fins contribute any propulsive force! Their main function is to control the stability and direction of the fish: as water passes over its body, a fish uses its fins to thrust in the direction it wishes to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>F</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fins located in different places on a fish serve different purposes, such as moving forward, turning, and keeping an upright position. The tail fin, in its final lash may contribute as much as 40 per cent of the forward thrust. The median fins, that is, the dorsal, anal and ventral fins, control the rolling and yawing movements of the fish by increasing the vertical surface area presented to the water. The paired fins, pectoral and pelvic act as hydroplanes and control the pitch of the ash, causing it to swim downwards or upwards according to the angle to the water at which they are held by their muscles. The pectoral fins lie in front of the centre of gravity and, being readily mobile, are chiefly responsible for sending the ash up or down. The paired ins are also the means by which the fish slows down and stops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>G</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The swimming speed of fish is not so fast as one would expect from watching their rapid movements in aquaria or ponds. Tuna seems to be the fastest at 44 mph, trout are recorded as doing 23 mph, pike 20 mph for short bursts and roach about 10 mph, while the majority of small fish probably do not exceed 2 or 3 mph. Many people have attempted to make accurate measurements of the speed at which various fish swim, either by timing them over known distances in their natural environment or by determining their performance in man-made swimming channels. From these studies, we can broadly categorise fish into four groups: &ldquo;sneakers&rdquo;, such as eels that are only capable of slow speeds but possess some staying power; &ldquo;stayers&rdquo;, that can swim quite fast over long periods; &ldquo;sprinters&rdquo; that can generate fast bursts of speed (e.g. pike); and &ldquo;crawlers&rdquo; that are sluggish swimmers, although they can accelerate slightly (bream, for example).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>H</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One type of sailfish is considered to be the fastest species of fish over short distances, achieving 68 mph over a three-second period, and anglers have recorded speeds in excess of 40 mph over longer periods for several species of tuna. One is likely to consider a fish&rsquo;s swimming capabilities in relation to its size. However, it is generally true that a small fish is a more able swimmer than a much larger one. On the other hand in terms of speed in miles per hour, a big fish will, all other things being equal, be able to swim faster than a smaller fish.</p>",

    passage:
      "<h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The history of tea</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The story of tea begins in China. According to legend, in 2737 BC, the Chinese emperor Shen Nung was sitting beneath a tree while his servant boiled drinking water, when some leaves from the tree blew into the water. Shen Nung, a renowned herbalist, decided to try the infusion that his servant had accidentally created. The tree was a Camellia sinensis, and the resulting drink was what we now call tea. It is impossible to know whether there is any truth in this story. But tea drinking certainly became established in China many centuries before it had even been heard of in the West. Containers for tea have been found in tombs dating from the Han Dynasty (206 BC&mdash;220 AD) but it was under the Tang Dynasty (618&mdash;906 AD), that tea became firmly established as the national drink of China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It became such a favourite that during the late eighth century a writer called Lu Yu wrote the first book entirely about tea, the Ch&rsquo;a Ching, or Tea Classic. It was shortly after this that tea was first introduced to Japan, by Japanese Buddhist monks who had travelled to China to study. Tea received almost instant imperial sponsorship and spread rapidly from the royal court and monasteries to the other sections of Japanese society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So at this stage in the history of tea, Europe was rather lagging behind. In the latter half of the sixteenth century there are the first brief mentions of tea as a drink among Europeans. These are mostly from Portuguese who were living in the East as traders and missionaries. But although some of these individuals may have brought back samples of tea to their native country, it was not the Portuguese who were the first to ship back tea as a commercial import. This was done by the Dutch, who in the last years of the sixteenth century began to encroach on Portuguese trading routes in the East. By the turn of the century they had established a trading post on the island of Java, and it was via Java that in 1606 the first consignment of tea was shipped from China to Holland. Tea soon became a fashionable drink among the Dutch, and from there spread to other countries in continental western Europe, but because of its high price it remained a drink for the wealthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Britain, always a little suspicious of continental trends, had yet to become the nation of tea drinkers that it is today. Starting in 1600, the British East India Company had a monopoly on importing goods from outside Europe, and it is likely that sailors on these ships brought tea home as gifts. The first coffee house had been established in London in 1652, and tea was still somewhat unfamiliar to most readers, so it is fair to assume that the drink was still something of a curiosity. Gradually, it became a popular drink in coffee houses, which were as many locations for the transaction of business as they were for relaxation or pleasure. They were though the preserve of middle- and upper-class men; women drank tea in their own homes, and as yet tea was still too expensive to be widespread among the working classes. In part, its high price was due to a punitive system of taxation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One unforeseen consequence of the taxation of tea was the growth of methods to avoid taxation&mdash;smuggling and adulteration. By the eighteenth century many Britons wanted to drink tea but could not afford the high prices, and their enthusiasm for the drink was matched by the enthusiasm of criminal gangs to smuggle it in. What began as a small time illegal trade, selling a few pounds of tea to personal contacts, developed by die late eighteenth century into an astonishing organised crime network, perhaps importing as much as 7 million lbs annually, compared to a legal import of 5 million lbs! Worse for die drinkers was that taxation also encouraged the adulteration of tea, particularly of smuggled tea which was not quality controlled through customs and excise. Leaves from other plants, or leaves which had already been brewed and then dried, were added to tea leaves. By 1784, the government realised that enough was enough, and that heavy taxation was creating more problems than it was words. The new Prime Minister, William Pitt the Younger, slashed the tax from 119 per cent to 12.5 per cent. Suddenly legal tea was affordable, and smuggling stopped virtually overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another great impetus to tea drinking resulted from the end of the East India Company&rsquo;s monopoly on trade with China, in 1834. Before that date, China was the country of origin of the vast majority of the tea imported to Britain, but the end of its monopoly stimulated the East India Company to consider growing tea outside China. India had always been the centre of the Company&rsquo;s operations, which led to the increased cultivation of tea in India, beginning in Assam. There were a few false starts, including the destruction by cattle of one of the earliest tea nurseries, but by 1888 British tea imports from India were for the first time greater than those from China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The end of the East India Company&rsquo;s monopoly on trade with China also had another result, which was more dramatic though less important in the long term: it ushered in the era of the tea clippers. While the Company had had the monopoly on trade, there was no rush to bring the tea from China to Britain, but after 1834 the tea trade became a virtual free for all. Individual merchants and sea captains with their own ships raced to bring home the tea and make the most money, using fast new clippers which had sleek lines, tall masts and huge sails. In particular there was a competition between British and American merchants, leading to the famous clipper races of the 1860s. But these races soon came to an end with the opening of the Suez Canal, which made the trade routes to China viable for steamships for the first time.</p>",

    passage:
      "<h2>Making Copier</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>At first, nobody bought Chester Carlson&rsquo;s strange idea. But trillions of documents later, his invention is the biggest thing in printing since Gutenberg</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Copying is the engine of civilization: culture is behavior duplicated. The oldest copier invented by people is language, by which an idea of yours becomes an idea of mine. The second great copying machine was writing. When the Sumerians transposed spoken words into stylus marks on clay tablets more than 5,000 years ago, the hugely extended the human network that language had created. Writing freed copying from the chain of living contact. It made ideas permanent, portable and endlessly reproducible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>B</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until Johann Gutenberg invented the printing press in the mid-1400s, producing a book in an edition of more than one generally meant writing it out again. Printing with moveable type was not copying, however. Gutenberg couldn&rsquo;t take a document that already existed, feed it into his printing press and run off facsimiles. The first true mechanical copier was manufactured in 1780, when James Watt, who is better known as the inventor of the modern steam engine, created the copying press. Few people today know what a copying press was, but you may have seen one in an antique store, where it was perhaps called a book press. A user took a document freshly written in special ink, placed a moistened sheet of translucent paper against the inked surface and squeezed the two sheets together in the press, causing some of the ink from the original to penetrate the second sheet, which could then be read by turning it over and looking through its back. The high cost prohibits the widespread use of this copier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>C</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the first modem copying machines, introduced in 1950 by 3M, was the Thermo-Fax, and it made a copy by shining infrared light through an original document and a sheet of paper that had been coated with heat-sensitive chemicals. Competing manufacturers soon introduced other copying technologies and marketed machines called Dupliton, Dial-A-Matic Autostat, Verifax, Copease and Copymation. These machines and their successors were welcomed by secretaries, who had no other means of reproducing documents in hand, but each had serious drawbacks. All required expensive chemically treated papers. And all made copies that smelled bad, were hard to read, didn&rsquo;t last long and tended to curl up into tubes. The machines were displaced, beginning in the late 1800s, by a combination of two 19th century inventions: the typewriter and carbon paper. For those reasons, copying presses were standard equipment in offices for nearly a century and a half.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>D</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of those machines is still manufactured today. They were all made obsolete by a radically different machine, which had been developed by an obscure photographic-supply company. That company had been founded in 1906 as the Haloid Company and is known today as the Xerox Corporation. In 1959, it introduced an office copier called the Haloid Xerox 914, a machine that, unlike its numerous competitors, made sharp, permanent copies on ordinary paper-a huge breakthrough. The process, which Haloid called xerography (based on Greek words meaning &ldquo;dry&rdquo; and &ldquo;writing&rdquo;), was so unusual and nonnutritive that physicists who visited the drafty warehouses where the first machines were built sometimes expressed doubt that it was even theoretically feasible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>E</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remarkably, xerography was conceived by one person- Chester Carlson, a shy, soft-spoken patent attorney, who grew up in almost unspeakable poverty and worked his way through junior college and the California Institute of Technology. Chester Carlson was born in Seattle in 1906. His parents-Olof Adolph Carlson and Ellen Josephine Hawkins&mdash;had grown up on neighboring farms in Grove City, Minnesota, a tiny Swedish farming community about 75 miles west of Minneapolis. Compare with competitors, Carlson was not a normal inventor in 20-century. He made his discovery in solitude in 1937 and offered it to more than 20 major corporations, among them IBM, General Electric, Eastman Kodak and RCA. All of them turned him down, expressing what he later called &ldquo;an enthusiastic lack of interest&rdquo; and thereby passing up the opportunity to manufacture what Fortune magazine would describe as &ldquo;the most successful product ever marketed in America.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>F</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carlson&rsquo;s invention was indeed a commercial triumph. Essentially overnight, people began making copies at a rate that was orders of magnitude higher than anyone had believed possible. And the rate is still growing. In fact, most documents handled by a typical American office worker today are produced xerographically, either on copiers manufactured by Xerox and its competitors or on laser printers, which employ the same process (and were invented, in the 1970s, by a Xerox researcher). This year, the world will produce more than three trillion xerographic copies and laser-printed pages&mdash;about 500 for every human on earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>G</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Xerography eventually made Carlson a very wealthy man. (His royalties amounted to something like a 16th of a cent for every Xerox copy made, worldwide, through 1965.) Nevertheless, he lived simply. He never owned a second home or a second car, and his wife had to urge him not to buy third-class train tickets when he traveled in Europe. People who knew him casually seldom suspected that he was rich or even well-to-do; when Carlson told an acquaintance he worked at Xerox, the man assumed he was a factory worker and asked if he belonged to a union. &ldquo;His possessions seemed to be composed of the number of things he could easily do without,&rdquo; his second wife said. He spent the last years of his life quietly giving most of his fortune to charities. When he died in 1968, among the eulogizers was the secretary-general of the United Nations.</p>",

    passage:
      "<h2>Neuroaesthetics</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An emerging discipline called neuroaesthetics is seeking to bring scientific objectivity to the study of art, and has already given us a better understanding of many masterpieces. The blurred imagery of Impressionist paintings seems to stimulate the brain&#39;s amygdala, for instance. Since the amygdala plays a crucial role in our feelings, that finding might explain why&nbsp;many people find these pieces so moving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could the same approach also shed light on abstract twentieth-century pieces, from Mondrian&#39;s geometrical blocks of colour, to Pollock&#39;s seemingly haphazard arrangements&nbsp;of splashed paint on canvas? Sceptics believe that people claim to like such works simply&nbsp;because they are famous. We certainly do have an inclination to follow the crowd. When&nbsp;asked to make simple perceptual decisions such as matching a shape to its rotated image, for&nbsp;example, people often choose a definitively wrong answer if they see others doing the same. It is easy to imagine that this mentality would have even more impact on a fuzzy concept like art appreciation, where there is no right or wrong answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Angelina Hawley-Dolan, of Boston College, Massachusetts, responded to this debate by asking volunteers to view pairs of paintings - either the creations of famous abstract artists or&nbsp;the doodles of infants, chimps and elephants. They then had to judge which they preferred.&nbsp;A third of the paintings were given no captions, while many were labelled incorrectly -volunteers might think they were viewing a chimp&#39;s messy brushstrokes when they were actually seeing an acclaimed masterpiece. In each set of trials, volunteers generally preferred&nbsp;the work of renowned artists, even when they believed it was by an animal or a child. It seems&nbsp;that the viewer can sense the artist&#39;s vision in paintings, even if they can&#39;t explain why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Robert Pepperell, an artist based at Cardiff University, creates ambiguous works that are neither entirely abstract nor clearly representational. In one study, Pepperell and his&nbsp;collaborators asked volunteers to decide how&#39;powerful&#39;they considered an artwork to be,&nbsp;and whether they saw anything familiar in the piece. The longer they took to answer these&nbsp;questions, the more highly they rated the piece under scrutiny, and the greater their neural&nbsp;activity. It would seem that the brain sees these images as puzzles, and the harder it is to&nbsp;decipher the meaning, the more rewarding is the moment of recognition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what about artists such as Mondrian, whose paintings consist exclusively of horizontal and vertical lines encasing blocks of colour? Mondrian&#39;s works are deceptively simple, but&nbsp;eye-tracking studies confirm that they are meticulously composed, and that simpiy rotating a&nbsp;piece radically changes the way we view it. With the originals, volunteers&#39;eyes tended to stay&nbsp;longer on certain places in the image, but with the altered versions they would flit across a&nbsp;piece more rapidly. As a result, the volunteers considered the altered versions less pleasurable&nbsp;when they later rated the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a similar study, Oshin Vartanian of Toronto University asked volunteers to compare original paintings with ones which he had altered by moving objects around within the frame. He&nbsp;found that almost everyone preferred the original, whether it was a Van Gogh still life or&nbsp;an abstract by Miro. Vartanian also found that changing the composition of the paintings&nbsp;reduced activation in those brain areas linked with meaning and interpretation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In another experiment, Alex Forsythe of the University of Liverpool analysed the visual intricacy of different pieces of art, and her results suggest that many artists use a key level of&nbsp;detail to please the brain. Too little and the work is boring, but too much results in a kind of&nbsp;&#39;perceptual overload&#39;, according to Forsythe. What&#39;s more, appealing pieces both abstract and&nbsp;representational, show signs of &#39;fractals&#39; - repeated motifs recurring in different scales, fractals&nbsp;are common throughout nature, for example in the shapes of mountain peaks or the branches&nbsp;of trees. It is possible that our visual system, which evolved in the great outdoors, finds it&nbsp;easier to process such patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also intriguing that the brain appears to process movement when we see a handwritten letter, as if we are replaying the writer&#39;s moment of creation. This has led some to wonder&nbsp;whether Pollock&#39;s works feel so dynamic because the brain reconstructs the energetic actions&nbsp;the artist used as he painted. This may be down to our brain&#39;s &#39;mirror neurons&#39;, which are&nbsp;known to mimic others&#39; actions. The hypothesis will need to be thoroughly tested, however. It&nbsp;might even be the case that we could use neuroaesthetic studies to understand the longevity&nbsp;of some pieces of artwork. While the fashions of the time might shape what is currently&nbsp;popular, works that are best adapted to our visual system may be the most likely to linger&nbsp;once the trends of previous generations have been forgotten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s still early days for the field of neuroaesthetics - and these studies are probably only a taste of what is to come. It would, however, be foolish to reduce art appreciation to a set of scientific&nbsp;laws. We shouldn&#39;t underestimate the importance of the style of a particular artist, their place&nbsp;in history and the artistic environment of their time. Abstract art offers both a challenge and the freedom to play with different interpretations. In some ways, it&#39;s not so different to science,&nbsp;where we are constantly looking for systems and decoding meaning so that we can view and&nbsp;appreciate the world in a new way.</p>",
